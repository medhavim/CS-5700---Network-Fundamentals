Milestone:
----------

1) Implementing DNS
We extract the DNS packet and parse the question section in the packet to get the domain name. We are presently retruning a default replica server for all queries. In the future, active measurements will be used to obtain the best replica server and a response will be constructed with the best replica server.

2) Implementing HTTP Server
In the submitted program we take the port number and the Origin server as the input from the user and the create a GET request HTTP packet to get the data requested by the client. We have used a HTTPServer to bind the port number recieved. Once a request is recieved the do_GET method of the HTTPHandler will be called. Based on a future caching mechanism, the file will be recieved either by the origin or the existing cache to GET the contents of the requested page. 

Challenges faced:
1) The program is really huge and complex. Understanding the various requirements and the means to do that was very challenging.
2) The setting up pf the EC2 hosts to login without password took longer than expected.
3) Understanding Zipf's Law for implementing the caching mechanism.
4) Understanding and implementingthe DNS server creation
5) Testing
