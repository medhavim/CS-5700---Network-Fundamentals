High-Level Approach : 

We understood that we had to create a TCP socket to communicate with the server. We went through python documentation 
on socket programming and understood how connections to the server can be made. 

We started out by creating a socket and tried to connect to the server at the given address and port. 
We followed the instructions given in the problem and sent a message to the server with the format given. 
Once the server sent back the reply, we understood that we had to evaluate the reply containing expressions 
and send it back it to the server. Eventually we were able to solve all expressions and obtain the secret flag. 

Problems faced : 

We tried to connect to the server from our home network. We couldn't establish a connection for about two days. 
We realized from piazza that we had to login to ccs servers or get into Northeastern Network to connect to the server. 

With SSL, we were not able to establish handshake with the recommended python class ssl.create_default_context. 
When we traced our program, we figured out that the class was not using the right settings to create an SSL connection. 
We used another class ssl.wrap_socket directly to avoid this issue. 

Testing : 

1) We tested our code by sending wrong results to the server to see if it failed.
2) We sent result in an incorrect format to see if the server threw an exception.
3) We tested our program with different port numbers as input.
4) We tested with out of range port numbers. 
5) We ran our application with and without ssl parameter supplied to the program.
6) We have implementing error handling in code to gracefully exit the program in case an unexpected error shows up.
